This module defines a custom user model for a Django application,
extending Django's built-in AbstractUser to include additional fields
for user profile management.
It includes:
- A profile photo field for user avatars.
- Many-to-many relationships for following and blocking other users.
This allows users to manage their social interactions within the application.
